# Body-Mass-Index-Calculator

This project, completed as part of a Java programming class taught by Professor Karina Sigala at New Mexico State University, calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. The BMI is then used to determine whether the person is underweight, overweight, or has an optimal weight.

# Objectives
Create a class named BodyMassIndex
Implement a main method to execute the BMI calculation
Declare variables for weight, height, and BMI
Enable user input for weight and height
Calculate the BMI using the provided formula
Display the calculated BMI and provide a message indicating the person's weight status

# How to Use

Clone or download the repository.
Compile the BodyMassIndex.java file.
Run the compiled program.
Follow the prompts to enter your weight in pounds and height in inches.
